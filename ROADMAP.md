## Roadmap ##

The roadmap here is a living document of where this generator is intending to go and things needed to be done in the near future;

Since we can't really predict the best way of doing things, this may be flexible and subject to change.

As of now, the things which will receive prioritization are:

- Add a section for project structure and the rationale/benefits for these in the Wiki.
- Provide a default ideal way and examples for using selectors on the Redux side
- Create a generator parameter to instantly augment your Redux application with new empty slices and their boilerplate.
- Tests
- Set up a linter (preferably at this point, with styles referenced in AirBNB React style guide as the defaults)
